# A-Primer-on-Quantile-Regression-for-Epidemiologists 
#### By Aayush Khadka, Jilly Hebert, and Anusha Vable

Quantile regression is a powerful method of evaluating how an exposure affects the entire outcome distribution; this is distinct from analyses on how exposures impact the means, which are more common in the epidemiological literature. However, quantile regression remains underused in epidemiology. Our workshop has two aims: 1) introduce participants to quantile regressions with a focus on distinguishing between estimators targeted at the conditional versus marginal outcome distribution; and 2) equip participants to conduct quantile regression analyses in statistical packages such as R or Stata. Our workshop has three phases. Phase 1 will be theoretically oriented and will provide participants with knowledge of quantile regression theory. Phase 2 will be empirically oriented and will provide participants with hands-on experience of fitting quantile regressions to a dataset we will provide. Phase 3 will sketch extensions to quantile regressions, such as quantile regression estimators for longitudinal data. Phases 1 and 2 will form the bulk of the workshop. All sessions will be interactive to encourage hands-on experience and learning. Our workshop is targeted at beginners, i.e., individuals with no prior experience of using quantile regressions. However, we do presume that participants have a working knowledge of linear regressions since we will use mean models (ordinary least squares regression) as the starting point to develop ideas about quantile regressions.
